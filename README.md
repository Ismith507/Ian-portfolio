# Ian's Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. Next is a [React](https://react.dev/) framework that allows for server-side rendering, API routes and more.

It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a superset of JavaScript, for type safety.

## Prerequisites

You'll need these globally installed on your machine:

[Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (javascript runtime)

[PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) (package manager)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/(home)/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
